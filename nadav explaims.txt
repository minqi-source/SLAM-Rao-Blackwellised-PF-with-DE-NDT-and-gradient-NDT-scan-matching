here i preform SLAM with Nm maps, where each map has Np particles

there are versions without Scan Matching (SM) and versions with.

The primery scripts: (learning curve scripts)
SLAM_different_Np_Nm - learning curve script, i dont remember if it runs
SLAM_different_Np_Nm_V2_small_chanes_and commentt - learning curve script, i dont remember if it runs
SLAM_different_Np_Nm_V3 - learning curve script, i dont remember if it runs

The primery scripts: (working versions)
SLAM_different_Np_Nm_V4 - no scan matching
SLAM_different_Np_Nm_V5_argmax - no scan matching
SLAM_different_Np_Nm_V6_fminconScanMatch - Yes scan matching, works poorly


All other functions and scripts in the folder have good description in them. 
you may see alot of versions of the same function, for example weigh_particles_slam,weigh_particles_slam2,weigh_particles_slam3
ect.. in each vesrion there is an explenation how it differs from the previous version (usually small changes like using L
scans instead of all), and usually the most recent primary script, will use the most recent function, for example SLAM_different_Np_Nm_V3.m 
will make use of weigh_particles_slam3.m


Notice! update_map.m is not good as it updates x, y crdnts in different order, use only update_map2.m!!!!!!! it doesn


The folder "done - only essenital functions and data sets" contains only the relevant functions to run, so as to not have 
balagan (they are all copied from this folder).
